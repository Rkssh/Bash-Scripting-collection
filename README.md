Click the "Download" button to download the script to your local machine.
Make the script executable (if needed):

Run the following command:
bash
Copy code
chmod +x script-name.sh
Replace script-name.sh with the name of the script you want to run.

Run the script:
In the terminal, navigate to the directory where the script is saved.
